Create CSV from Directory Script

  What is it?
  -----------

  There are two standalone scripts. They take as input a file 
  folder and output a CSV of the file names of the contents 
  of the directory.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  I wrote this in 2010 and haven't updated it much since.
  I will take updates and patches but I don't use it too much
  anymore.
